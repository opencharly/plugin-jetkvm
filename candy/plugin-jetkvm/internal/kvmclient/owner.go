// DefaultControlLeaseTimeout bounds how long a caller may hold the control
// lease without releasing it. A caller that simply stops calling us (crash,
// hang, forgotten Release) therefore triggers a bounded neutralization attempt;
// failure remains explicit because no client can guarantee attached-host state.
const DefaultControlLeaseTimeout = 30 * time.Second

// neutralizeTimeout bounds the release-all that ends every lease. It is
// deliberately independent of the holder's context, which is usually
// already dead by the time a lease ends.

// controlLease is the single point through which keyboard/mouse commands
// flow for a Client. What it actually guarantees, and what the tests in
// owner_test.go and hid_test.go prove:
//
//   - Exclusivity: at most one holder at a time. Acquire waits (bounded by
//     its context); TryAcquire reports ErrControlHeld for an occupied slot or
//     ErrControlLifecycleBusy for an in-progress release instead of queuing.
//   - Generation validation: every holder gets a fresh, never-reused token
//     from the HID state machine, and every frame is re-validated against
//     the currently-active token at the last moment before it is written.
//     A frame authorized by an ended lease is dropped, not delivered late.
//   - Terminal neutralization: however the lease ends - explicit Release,
//     context cancellation, inactivity timeout, disconnect, or Client
//     shutdown - the generation is revoked first. Neutral reports pre-empt
//     the application queue and follow any bytes Pion already accepted on
//     the ordered channel.
//   - Bounded, truthful transport semantics: Pion buffering is capped before
//     Send, and release success waits for its outbound amount to reach zero.
//     Otherwise ErrNeutralizeUnverified is returned and held state is kept.
//
// It is created disabled (hid == nil) unless the Client was connected with
// AllowControl: true, so a caller that never opted into control cannot
// construct a working lease at all.
//
// Lock ordering: the lease's slot semaphore is acquired before
// hidClient.stateMu, never the other way around. The semaphore is a
// channel rather than a mutex specifically so acquisition can respect a
// context without leaking a goroutine per waiter.
