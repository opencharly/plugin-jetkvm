// b3c29a4 ("Set video codec before native stream start (#1509)"), cloned
// and read on 2026-08-02. Nothing here is a published, versioned API:
// jetkvm/kvm ships no protocol spec, only a Go implementation of both
// server and reference (browser) client. These constants exist so a
// version drift on the device produces an actionable error instead of a
// silent hang or confusing low-level failure.
