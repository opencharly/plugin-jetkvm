// The two RFC 6184 packet type values that are not themselves H.264 NAL unit
// types but do appear in this stream. The others it defines - STAP-B (25),
// MTAP16 (26), MTAP24 (27) and FU-B (29) - are never produced by Pion's
// H264Payloader, which is what packetizes on the device, so one showing up
// is itself the finding and is counted as rtpClassOther.

// Sizing the access-unit reassembly window.
//
// The sample builder holds RTP packets until it can prove an access unit is
// complete, and force-drops the oldest ones once the buffered sequence range
// exceeds its window. Anything dropped that way takes the whole access unit
// with it: the remainder no longer starts on a partition head, so the
// builder discards it (samplebuilder.go, buildSample's IsPartitionHead
// check).
//
// This window used to be 50 packets, which is smaller than a single 1080p
// keyframe. The effect was invisible in aggregate and precisely wrong: every
// small inter frame passed through, every keyframe was shredded, and with it
// the SPS/PPS that the encoder aggregates into the same access unit. The
// 2026-08-05 live run showed exactly that shape - 10,186 RTP packets, 2,106
// assembled access units, every one of them non-IDR, no SPS, no PPS - and it
// was read as "the encoder never emitted a keyframe" when the device had in
// fact emitted one roughly every half second.
//
// The replacement is derived from published bounds rather than chosen:
//
//	device max encoded frame   width*height*3/2 bytes, at the 1920x1080 mode
//	                           the device's EDID advertises as preferred
//	                           (jetkvm/kvm internal/native/cgo/video.c:
//	                           "stAttr->stVencAttr.u32BufSize = width * height * 3 / 2")
//	Pion outbound MTU          1200 bytes (pion/webrtc/v4 constants.go,

//	                           firmware writes frames to)
//	RTP fixed header           12 bytes, subtracted by pion/rtp's packetizer

//

// fragments. nonSliceNALUAllowance covers the parameter-set and SEI NAL
// units the encoder bundles into the same access unit, each of which is its
// own packet.
//
// Memory stays bounded: the builder can hold at most maxAccessUnitPackets

// Widening the packet window above without this would have traded one stall
// for another: a single lost packet would hold every later frame hostage
// until maxAccessUnitPackets of them had accumulated, which at the observed
// packet rate is the better part of ten seconds.
//
// The bound is small because waiting is worthless here. The firmware drains
// inbound RTCP without parsing it (jetkvm/kvm webrtc.go, drainRTCP), so
// neither a NACK nor a PLI from this client can bring the missing packet
// back; the only repair is the encoder's next unprompted IDR, which arrives
// about every half second (internal/native/cgo/video.c: "gop = fps > 0 ?
// fps / 2 : 30"). Giving up within half a GOP costs at most one keyframe.

// What sets the floor is reordering tolerance, not frame size: every packet
